Path Planning Project
-------------

The goal of the project is to arrive at path of a car in a highway environment simulator that drives the car safely with out any collision with other cars and with no jerks or max accelerations.  A simulator is provided as part of the project along with a base starter code. In addition to that, a set of sparse way point is also provided.  We have to arrive at a Jerk minimizing path that drives with in speed limit of 50MPH passing other vehicles sharing the highway.  The simulator provides the car's current telemetry data along with the sensor fusion data about the other cars on the road.  It also provides the previous path of the car that was used by the car in the previous step.

##### **Approach**

There are three portions in this project.  The first one is to plan a path that minimizes the jerk.  Next is to accelerate the vehicle to move it in the planned path.  And the third one is to use sensor fusion data to navigate through other cars either by passing them or reducing speed or both as appropriate. 

##### **Path Planning**

Jerk Minimizing Trajectory is a quintic polynominal equation which can be solved between two sparse way points and arrive at possible trajectories.  From those trajectories, each of them can be assessed to check whether it is safe to proceed in that path using other environmental data.  This quintic polynominal equations can be solved on our own (using the lesson exercises) or we can use any readily available libraries instead of reinventing the wheel.  As per the suggestion provided, spline is one the libraries available for C++ to solve such equation.  In my code, I have used spline library to solve the equation and arrive at the trajectory.  In the spline variable, we will set the coordinates of where the car wants to be in different time steps.  It generates a smooth path between those points and provides the y coordinates for any given x coordinate.  Instead of generating the path from scratch, we use the previous path's unused points and just add few additional points to keep the path points length to 50.  In this way, we can maintain the continuity of the car position and also avoid any jerk both in horizontal and vertical directions.

##### **Vehicle Speed**

The vehicle speed is controlled step by step by checking its current speed and whether any vehicle is in its front.  To avoid any jerk, the acceleration is done step by step.

##### **Sensor Fusion**

In the given simulator, the other vehicles sharing the highway will also move freely at different speed and change lanes as they deem appropriate.  The other vehicles' details are provided as sensor fusion data.  In order to find whether there is any obstacle in the road, we should be using this sensor fusion data and understand the environment around us.  Based on our environment, determine whether to continue moving in the same speed, or change lane &/or reduce speed. In my code, there is a function called `find_lane_to_shift` which houses the logic to determine which lane to shift.  It uses a simple cost based evaluation of various vehicles that are in front and adjacent lanes.  Depending up on the cost, our car either changes the lane to left or right or remains in the same lane and reduces its speed.

##### **Result & Future Opportunities**

The car is able to drive in the simulator with out any major issues.  It is a very basic program that drives the car.  There are several opportunities to add to make it even smoother, safer & efficient.  Potential changes that can be added are, use own JMT instead of spline, instead of rough acceleration/deceleration, using a PIC or MPC controller.

# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
